 A sample notebook that shows how my notes are organized

## Key Folders

- People: This is where I store a "page" for each person. Everything about that person, and 1-on-1 meetings with them is captured there. If we're specfically meeting about a certain project, then those notes go in the page for the project.
- Daily: A note for each day. These are mostly transient, but the [calendar plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) makes it easy to review something that happened on a particular way. It also acts as a connector if I need to see close relationships between different topics.
- Tech Topics: Holds various tech topics. Once nice capability is the ability to have scripts/snippets inline. That way I can easily save code that I might want to reference at a later time. I can also link together related tech topics. Docker and Kubernetes, for example.
